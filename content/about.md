# Hello World!

My name is **Jan Max Meyer**, I'm a professional full stack software developer living near Dortmund, Germany.

With the age of 13, in 1998, I've started to write my first little programs in QBASIC on DOS. Since then, programming and computing in general became my passion.

In my professional life, I work as a senior full stack developer at a mid-sized software company in Dortmund, Germany, specialized on cloud software development for various customers in Europe.

Personally, I'm heavily interested into language engineering, several parsing topics, compilers, virtual machines and software development tools in general. This is where **Phorward Software Technologies** begins. It is the name of some kind of freelancing activity and avocational business I'm doing on my own and mostly in my spare time.

Beyond coding, I love flying both gliders and light aircraft for towing as my hobby.
