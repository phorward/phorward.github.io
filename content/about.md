Hi there!

My name is **Jan Max Meyer**, I'm living near Dortmund in Germany.

With the age of 13, I've started to create my first little programs in QBASIC on DOS. Since then, programming and computing in general became my passion, by curiosity.

In my professional life, I work as a senior full stack developer at a software company in Dortmund, specialized on cloud software development for various customers in Europe.

Personally, I'm heavily interested into language engineering, compilers, interpreters and virtual machines, any parsing topics in general, and software development tools. This is what **Phorward Software Technologies** is.

Beyond coding, I'm a passionate glider pilot.

# Skills

Here are some of my skills regarding information technology.

- Fluent in the general purpose programming languages **Rust**, **Python**, **C** and **JavaScript**, but I did also some C++, TypeScript, Java, awk, bash, Pascal, Basic.
- Expertise in practical *compiler construction* and *language engineering*, including **lex/yacc**, **unicc**, **tokay** and similar tools,<br>with backgrounds on various *parsing algorithms* and methodics, including LL/LR/LALR/GLR/GLL, PEG & hand-crafted recursive descent parsing
- Experienced in web-development with **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** and several more web-technologies (but I'm not a web-designer!)
- Knowlege in several **SQL**-dialects and DBMS including *Oracle*, *Informix*, *MySQL*, *MariaDB*, *SQLite*
- Cloud experience with **Google Cloud** and its products like AppEngine, Cloud Functions, Datastore, Big Table
- Advanced **Linux** user

## Software development tools

- since 2014: Contributor of [`ViUR`](https://www.viur.dev), an open source application development framework for the Google Cloud App Engine platform, and several tools related to it (*Python*)
- 2013: `Shell Scripting Extensions` interface providing command-line tools to build graphical UI-interactions with arbitrary scripting languages on a client/server Unix-based ERP-software-architecture (*C, bash*)
- 2013: `gendoc, etc.` internal tools for source code maintenance and documentation (*bash, awk, sed, txt2tags, htmldoc, pdftk*)
- 2012: `impact`, a report generator library with dynamic database querying and integrated Excel-style formula-language and value concept (*C, unicc*)
- since 2006: [`libphorward`](https://github.com/phorward/libphorward), a C/C++ library providing a modular regular expression engine with full Unicode-support, amongst other tools (written from scratch in *C*)
