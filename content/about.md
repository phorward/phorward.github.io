# Hi there!

My name is **Jan Max Meyer**, I'm a professional full stack software developer living near Dortmund, Germany.

In 1998, with the age of 13, I started to create my first little programs in QBASIC on DOS. Since then, programming became my passion.

In my professional life, I work as senior full stack developer at a mid-size software company in Dortmund, specialized on cloud software development for various customers in Europe.

Personally I'm heavily interested into engineering programming languages and domain specific languages, parsing in general, compilers and virtual machines, or software development tools in general. This is where **Phorward Software Technologies** begins. It is the name of some kind of freelancing activity and avocational business I'm doing on my own and mostly in my spare time.

# Skills
