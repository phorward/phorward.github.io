# About me

![This is a picture of me](/jmm.jpg)

Hi there! My name is **Jan Max Meyer**, I'm a professional full stack software developer from Schwerte, Germany.

With the age of 13, I started to code my first programs in QBASIC on DOS, which was around 1998. Since then, programming became my passion.

In my professional life, I work as a senior full stack developer at **[Mausbrand Informationssysteme GmbH](https://www.mausbrand.de/)** in Dortmund. The company specializes on the development of custom, cloud-based software applications running on top of the Google App Engine platform.

Personally I'm heavily interested into the engineering of *programming languages* and *domain specific languages*, including their *parsers*, *compilers* and *interpretation*, but even other *software development tools*. This is where **Phorward Software Technologies** comes in. It is the name of some kind of freelancing activity and avocational business which is maintained by myself.

# Skills

Here's a short line-up of my skills and activites related to computing.

## Languages

Since 2005, I worked as a systems software developer specialized into **C** programming. Since 2014, I entirely switched into web technologies and learned to code full stack in **Python**. Since 2020, I've started to discover **Rust** and doing some stuff with it. Of course, due to my web technologies experience, I speak **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **Jinja2** and **CSS** fluently. **WebAssembly** is also a topic I'm much interested into.

Additionally, I have several experiences in *shell programming*, notably **bash** and **awk**.
**XML**, **XSLT** and **JSON** are well-known to me.
Languages like C++, Go, Java, Pascal, several BASIC dialects as well as Forth, WASM and some x86 assembly aren't foreign to me.

## Tools

Due to my personal interest in parsing technologies and compiler construction, I have detailed knowledge into several parsing algorithms, including **LR/LALR**, **PEG and packrat parsing**, **LL** as well as **generalized LL and LR**, hand-crafted **recursive descent** and **parser combinators**. I've used tools like **flex** (lex) and **bison** (yacc) as well as my own tools (**unicc**) in professional projects in this area. I've implemented a Unicode-enabled regular expression engine on my own in C (**phorward**).

I've written and still write software for several DBMS, including Google's **Cloud Datastore** and **BigTable**, **MySQL**, **SQLite**, **Oracle** and **Informix Online**.

Surely, some further tools I'm familiar with are **git**, **autotools**, **Cmake**, **vim**, **mercurial**.

## Operating Systems

For sure, my operating system of choice is Linux. I'm on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) since 2008.

# Experience
