My name is **Jan Max Meyer**, I'm living near Dortmund, Germany.

In 1998, with the age of 13, I've started to create my first little programs in QBASIC on DOS. Since then, programming and computing in general became my passion.

In my professional life, I work as a senior full stack developer at a mid-sized software company in Dortmund, Germany, specialized on cloud software development for various customers in Europe.

Personally, I'm heavily interested into language engineering, several parsing topics, compilers, virtual machines and software development tools in general. This is where **Phorward Software Technologies** starts.

Beyond coding, I'm a passionate glider pilot and love to fly other aircraft for fun as well.
