# UniCC

**UniCC** is a scannerless LR/LALR parser generator. The idea behind UniCC was to provide a parser generator for several target languages, optionally with the ability to even compile and run one grammar definition into several targets without change. Until now, UniCC has full support for C, C++, Python (both 2.x and 3.x) and JavaScript. Parse tables, can also be generated into JSON and XML.

I've been working on it since 2008, but the project is currently discontinued. UniCC can be found [here](https://github.com/phorward/unicc). A 2014 started successor called [UniCCÂ²](https://github.com/phorward/unicc/tree/unicc2) remains unfinished.

# libphorward

The **libphorward** is a generic C/C++ library and toolbox, serving platform-independent utilities for different purposes. I've been working on it since 2006, but the project is currently discontinued.
